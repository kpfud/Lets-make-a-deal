# Lets-make-a-deal

This C# application simulates the classic **Monty Hall problem**, inspired by the game show *"Let's Make a Deal."* It includes both the logic behind the probability puzzle and a graphical interface built with Windows Forms.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of the Monty Hall problem
- GUI with clickable doors
- Option to switch or stay after host reveals a losing door
- Tracks wins and losses to illustrate the statistical advantage of switching

## Technologies Used

- C#
- Windows Forms
- Visual Studio (originally developed in)

## Status

The application was developed as part of a class project and is fully functional. I currently do not have access to Visual Studio, so I am unable to verify or update the GUI at this time.

## How to Run

1. Open `LetsMakeADeal.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the application to launch the interactive GUI.

> Note: Make sure all required files (`Form1.cs`, `Form1.Designer.cs`, `Program.cs`, and `.resx`) are in the same directory and included in the project.
